# Getting Started

1. Join the class Discord: **{{ variables.discord_link }}**
   - Use Discord to ask questions and get help from your fellow students, TAs, IAs, and myself
2. Register for the class Gradescope
   -  Gradescope link: **{{ variables.gradescope_link }}**
   -  Entry code: **{{ variables.gradescope_entry_code }}**
   -  When registering for **Gradescope** you must include your **Student ID/PID** and **UCSD Email**.
3. Make sure you attend the discussion sections during week 2 (no section during week 1)
4. Check this YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/FLrMklZEYek) to get to class (P.S. I definitely needed it)
5. Get ready to have some fun! (too cliche?)

# Course Readings

Readings come from a wide range of topics, papers, and articles to reflect the diverse nature of Cognitive Science, Robotics, and Computational Sciences. Some of these readings are critical ideas and papers that you will encounter again if you take additional Cognitive Science courses. These readings are fun and will hopefully introduce you to ideas and ways of thinking about 'the mind' that you have never encountered before. So strap up and prepare for a fun time! 

## Instructions
Each reading assignment will be coupled with a Reading Reflection. Use the link below to open the template and under `file` click `make a copy` to make a copy of the template for yourself in your drive. You will not be able to edit my template. Use the same template for each of the 4 reading reflections. Make sure to follow the instruction in the template and submit your reflection to Gradescope by the due date. 

**Reading Reflections Template:** <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEKo2E7-SWvIpQ-G7tBJWOm_RDY5s9Q5vyCBZqPAD80/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(open link)</a>

Make sure to submit your reading reflections through Gradescope! Do not email or bring a paper copy to class. If you have trouble submitting reach out to course staff on discord.

Readings come from a wide range of topics, papers, and articles to reflect the diverse nature of Cognitive Science, Robotics, and Computational Sciences. I try to strike a balance between research papers, technical blog posts and fun news-related readings.

The work of scientists and engineers requires extensive reading in day-to-day operations. Reading papers, meeting notes, emails, memos, project notes, and program documentation, just to name a few. The better your reading/writing abilities, the easier it will be to extract and disseminate information and knowledge. This is a fundamental and critical skill in.

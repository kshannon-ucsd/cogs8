# Course Readings

Readings come from a wide range of topics, papers, and articles to reflect the diverse nature of Cognitive Science, Robotics, and Computational Sciences. Some of these readings are critical ideas and papers that you will encounter again if you take additional Cognitive Science courses. These readings are fun and will hopefully introduce you to ideas and ways of thinking about 'the mind' that you have never encountered before. So strap up and prepare for a fun time!

There is no due date for readings, rather you will be expected to include ideas and discuss topics from the readings in your final paper and final class presentation. We have made suggestions in the course calendar for when we think you should begin a reading.

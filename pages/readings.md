<h1>Course Readings</h1>

Readings come from a wide range of topics, papers, and articles to reflect the diverse nature of Data Sci. Under each reading I provide some context for why they were selected and what general ideas you should be pulling out. I often get asked why there are so many readings in a science/engineering based course. This is a very simple question to answer.

The work of scientists and engineers requires extensive reading in day-to-day operations. Reading papers, meeting notes, emails, memos, project notes, and program documentation, just to name a few. The better your reading/writing abilities, the easier it will be to extract and disseminate information and knowledge. This is a fundamental and critical skill in, especially in data science. So please take the readings seriously and use them as practice to improve these fundamental skills, as well as, learn more about the field of data science.

# Activities

## Getting Started

{: .note .fs-2 }
We will cover some of the examples in this introduction to Microbit write up in class. But you should all work through these simple examples at home to get more practice with the Microbit. We will **not be grading** you on this "Getting Started" Activity.

## Introduction to Python Activities 
*Worth 10% of your grade*

### Activities: Hands-on Python 1 and 2

1. **Access the Materials**: 
   - Find the two `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook files on the course calendar with the DEMO tag, under week 1 and 2.
   
2. **Classwork**: 
   - We'll be working through these files during the first two weeks.
   
3. **Homework**: 
   - In addition to the classwork, there are 2 components for you to complete at home.
   
4. **Submission**:
   - Once finished with both notebooks, save each one as a PDF.
     - Inside the notebook, go to `print > save as PDF`.
   - Submit your PDFs via Gradescope for evaluation.

> **Note**: Perfection isn't the goal. Engage with the material, experiment, and familiarize yourself with beginner Python coding.

### Activity: Embedded Python + BBC Microbits

1. **Objective**: 
   - This is the last beginner-level Python activity. After this, we'll transition to working with robots.
   
2. **Classwork**: 
   - Work through a provided Jupyter notebook.
   - Access and utilize some online materials.
   
3. **Homework**: 
   - Continue your engagement with the materials using your microbits at home.
   
4. **Submission**: 
   - After completion, save your work as a PDF.
   - Submit the PDF via Gradescope.

## Course Materials

- There is **no** required textbook
- All course materials are provided through **this website** and in-class
- Final group project is submitted through **Gradescope**

## Course Objective

To explore the complex and loopy nature of sensorimotor systems in Cognitive Science. Using python and small microprocessors, we will build robotic systems with sensory systems to complete complex tasks. No prior programming experience is required, this course will teach you basic programming skills, build fundamental computational skills and thinking, as well as introduce you to some fundamental concepts within Cognitive Science, specifically embodied, embedded, and distributed cognition.

MicroPython along with the BBC Microbit processor is a perfect platform to quickly get your hands dirty working with actual systems. The skills you develop in this class will provide you with a good bedrock to continue building computation skills. I want to share with all of you my passion for working with data, hacking away with python, and the fascinating world of Cognitive Science!

## Grading & Attendance

| Bonus                                         |              N/A |        3 bonus pts |

- **Final exam date**: No final exam, only a final group project presentation/demo in week 10 and a report due during finals week.
- Your letter grade will be determined using the [standard grading scale](https://pages.stolaf.edu/dietz/typical-grading-scale/). Grades are not rounded up, that's why we have included bonus points.

### Regrade Policy

The regrade policy is here to protect students from serious issues in grading, not to provide students with a platform to argue about or plead for an extra point. A grader may incorrectly take off a point, but they are as likely to give students a point. In our experience less than 3% of the time a regrade results in a change.

**If you think a grading error has occurred please follow these steps:**

- You have 72 hours to request a regrade
- Initiate a regrade request by contacting your TA

### Lecture Attendance

The purpose of Cogs 8 is to get **hands-on** with computing. Therefore class lecture is mandatory after week 1 and a part of your grade. I know emergencies and personal issues do come up. You will be allowed to miss one class without any penalty. For further logistic issues, you will need to talk 1:1 with me or our TA. Due to the dynamic nature of this class, I will not be podcasting, therefore it is essential to make the time and effort to show up to our scheduled classroom activities.

**The attendance sign-in sheet will only be available for 15 minutes after the start of class. After which you will be unable to sign in.**

### Section Attendance

Section attendance is mandatory after week 1 as well. You will also be allowed to miss one discussion section. The discussion section is a perfect time to get additional help with programming, learn more about how to use python, or just have extra time to work on your in-class activities.

The attendance sign-in sheet will only be available for 5 minutes after the start of Discussion Section. After which you will be unable to sign in. 

### Office Hours

Office Hours will be held in the same classroom (except for Kyle's OH, which will be in his office), to allow students more time to come in and work on their activities and projects, as well as to interact 1:1 with course staff. Students will use a sign up sheet for office hours to make sure they recieve the attention the need. 

## Course Topics, Activities & Readings

### Topics

This class covers a wide range of topics. This is by design and meant to expose you to many topics within Cognitive Science, as well as get your hands messy writing some code and making real-world 'things' like robots! Some of the topics we will cover include:

- Python programming language (specifically micropython)
- Robotics
- Embodied cognition
- Distributed cognition
- Embedded cognition
- Brain in the Vat
- Microprocessors
- Sensorimotor systems
- Data processing

### Activities

Activities will focus on applying computational skills to build robotic-based agents that will sense and act in the real world. You do not need to have any prior programming experience. We will teach you how to perform basic programming, as well as provide you with a majority of the code you will need to get started with activities. The coding should not be a source of a terrible amount of anxiety. But you might sweat once or twice! :)

- We will walk you through an in-class demo on how to get everything set up to begin working on your robot.
- Several in-class activities where you will work both, individually and with your team. Most activities will be completed within the class, however, there will be extra time during the discussion section and during office hours to continue working on your Activities. You will be able to do some work at home as well.

Remember, this is NOT a programming class. We will use programming to learn about cognitive science. But the goal is to not overload you with complex programming tasks; however, you are at UCSD and we have an expectation of what students are capable of, so you will learn how to program in this class. It is just not the main focus :)


### Final Group Project

Your final group project will involve working with your classmates in a group of 8-12 students. You will have 2-3 weeks to work on your project, which will perform some complex activity in the real world, in a distributed manner, with other robots. Your group will demonstrate your robots interactivity and cognitive skills, or lack thereof, to the class in our final class meeting, as well as give a presentation on your distributed activity. There will be a final group report due during finals week. You will discuss what you learned, and relate your distributed robot task to the readings you have finished. This report should be about 6-7 pages.

### Planned Readings

Readings will cover many of the broad topics found within Cognitive Science & Robotics.

- R1: Meat Machines - Mindware as Software by Andy Clark
- R2: Is the Brain's Mind a Computer Program? by John Searle
- R3: Embodied cognition by Foglia & Wilson
- R4: Tools for the body (schema) by Maravita & Iriki
- R5: Distributed Cognition: Toward a New Foundation for Human-Computer Interaction Research by Hollan, Hutchins, & Kirsch
- R6: Designing Emergent Behaviors: From Local Intelligence to Collective Intelligence by Mataric

## Other Good Stuff

### Teamwork Expectations

Your team will be working on the final together. We expect all students to, more or less, be equal contributors to the final project. No one person should be doing a project, they are meant to be collaborative and give you experience working with people you probably do not know. One successful approach is to first agree on a communication tool/protocol and a schedule. Next, discuss each person's strengths and divide up responsibilities. Develop a schedule for completing tasks, who is responsible, and a backup person in case an emergency occurs. Finally, check in regularly to ensure progress is being made and leave some time to check and proofread each other's work. Especially because some students in your group may be remote for part of the class.

**Dealing with non-cooperative team members** -- If an issue occurs first try to work the issue out within your group. Save all documentation, emails, and chats as a record in case you need to contact the course staff. We will step in and try to communicate with the student(s) to reach a resolution. If no resolution can be made, or the problem resurfaces, we reserve the right to move the student to a new group, and grade that student separately from the group or any other action to resolve the issue.

**Group work is never easy** -- Teamwork, while difficult (especially during potentially remote interaction), is one of the most important skills you should learn and practice during college. In order to succeed, communication is critical. You need to be in contact with your group regularly. This will help you keep on top of deliverables and make adjustments if problems should arise. We are always here to help, and make use of our experience working on real engineering/science projects.

### Equipment Replacement Policy

All the robotic equipment loaned out to the students for this class are subjected to a replacement policy under the circumstance that they are lost/stolen/misplaced. You will not be penalized for broken or damaged parts as long as you can return the loaned parts back to the instructor or TAs before the end of finals week of the quarter. In the instance that the loaned part cannot be returned in any shape or form, you will be required to pay the following amount to cover the cost of replacing the part. 
- For a BBC Micro:Bit - $10 - individual covers the cost <br> 
- Pixy Cam and/or Servo attachment - $50 - group splits the cost <br> 
- Smart Robot - $50 - group splits the cost <br> 

Please understand this is a non-negotiable policy that you are expected to adhere to. So we would advise you take care of the equipment loaned to you. 

### Class/Web Conduct

In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the UC San Diego [principles of the community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).

This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.

At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.

If you have a concern, please speak with me, or the TA. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that's ok! The [OPHD](https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html) (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and [CARE](https://care.ucsd.edu/) (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.

### Academic Integrity

Don't cheat.

You are encouraged to (and at times will have to) work together and help one another. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit (quizzes/exams). For assignments, it is also your responsibility to ensure you understand everything your group has submitted and to make sure the correct file has been uploaded, that the upload is uncorrupted and that it renders correctly. Projects may include ideas and code from other sources—but these other sources must be documented with clear attribution. Please review academic integrity policies [here](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu).

We anticipate you all doing well in this course; however, if you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, that's ok! Should that occur, we recommend: (i.) asking questions in/after class, (ii.) attending office hours, and/or (iii.) reaching out to course staff.

Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, this website, or Gradescope is down, or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact course staff via email (attach your assignment/quiz/exam answers) or else it will be graded as late.

ChatGPT and other AI assisted products are becoming more commonplace in student's lives. I take the stance that most students will invariably use these tools, despite any sort of policy. Furthermore enforcing such a policy is overly burdensome. In class we will discuss the appropirate use of ChatGPT, and our expectations if you choose to use it to help you with your work. 

### Disability​ ​Access

Students requesting accommodations due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. To arrange accommodations please contact OSD and they will help you get situated and contact me with follow-up information/instructions.

OSD contact info:

### Questions & Feedback

**How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback**
It's great that we have many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we're able to get to everyone's questions.

That said, to ensure that we're respecting their time, the TA has been instructed they're only obligated to answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9am-5pm). However, I know that's not when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to reach out whenever is best for you while knowing that, you may not get a response until the next day. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question.

We have created a contact us section on the website. This is a form for you to fill out, which will generate an email template, please use that to reach out to course staff. Thank you!

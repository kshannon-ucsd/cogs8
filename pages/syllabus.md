## Course Objective

To explore thr complex and loopy nature of sensorimotor systems in Cognitive Science. Using python and small microprocessors, we will build robotic systems with sensory systems to complete complex tasks. No prior programming experience is required, this course will teach you basic programming skills, build fundamental computational skills and thinking, as well as introduce you to some fundamental concepts within Cognitive Science. 

Micropython along with the BBC Microbit processor is a perfect platform to quickly get your hands dirty working with actual systems. The skills you develop in this class will provide you with a good bedrock to continue building computation skills. I want to share with all of you my passion for working with data, hacking away with python, and the fascinating world of Cognitive Science!

| Bonus                                         |              N/A |        2 bonus pts |

- **Final exam date**: No final exam, only a final group project presentation in week 10 and a report due during finals week.
- Your letter grade will be determined using the [standard grading scale](https://pages.stolaf.edu/dietz/typical-grading-scale/). Grades are not rounded up, that’s why we have included 5 bonus points.



### Regrade Policy
The regrade policy is here to protect students from serious issues in grading, not to provide students with a platform to argue about, or plead for an extra point. A grader may incorrectly take off a point, but they are as likely to give students a point. In our experience less than 3% of the time a regrade results in a change.

**If you think a grading error has occurred please follow these steps:**
- You have 72 hours to request a regrade
- Initiate a regrade request on _________ TODO:

### Lecture Attendance
The purpose of Cogs 8 is to get hands-on with computing. Therefore class attendance is mandatory and a part of your grade. I know emergencies and personal issues do come up. You will be allowed to miss one class without any penalty. For further logistic issues, you will need to talk 1:1 with myself. Due to the dynamic nature of this class I will not be podcasting, therefore it is essential to make the time and effort to show up to our schedule classroom activities.

### Section Attendance
Section attendance is not mandatory, however, section is a perfect time to get additional help with programming problems, learn more about how to use python, or just have extra time to work on your lab modules.

### Office Hours
Office Hours will be held in the same classroom, to allow students more time to come in and work on their modules and projects, as well to interact 1:1 with course staff.

## Course Topics, Modules & Readings [TODO:]

### Topics
This class covers a wide range of topics. This is by design and meant to expose you to many topics within Cognitive Science, as well as getting your hands messy actually writing some code and making real world 'things' like robots! Some of the topics we will cover indlude:

- Python programming language (specifically micropython)
- Robotics
- Embodied cognition
- Distributed cognition
- Embedded cognition
- Microprocessors
- Human senses (e.g. sight, sound, and so on)
- Data processing


### Modules
Modules will focus on applying computation skills to build robotic based agents that will sense and act in the real world 

- One intro setting up your environment module that is ungraded, but will help you to get the hang of how the class will work.
- Seven in class modules where you will work individually with your own microprocessor. Each module should be completed within class, however there will be extra time during discussion section and during office hours to continue working on your modules. 
- Each module will have a series of questions and milestones that you will need to hit to gain full credit.

### Final Group Project
Your final group project will involve working with your classmates in a group of 3-5 students. You will have 2-3 weeks to work on robot(s) that use several types of senses to perform some complex activity in the real world. You will demonstrate your robot to the class in the final class meeting. There will be a final group report due finals week. You will discuss what you learned, and relate your invention back to the readings you have done and everything we have learned in class. This report should be about 3-6 pages. 

### Reading Reflections
There will be 54 reading reflections with two readings per assignment. Each reading reflection will ask you to summarize the high level concepts in each reading and relate them to what we are learning in class. Each reflection should be no more than one - two pages.

### Planned Readings
Readings will cover many of the broad topics found within Data Science, both from an academic and industry perspective.

## Other Good Stuff [DONE]

### Teamwork Expectations
Your team will be working on the final together. We expect all students to, more or less, be equal contributors the final project. No one person should be doing a project, they are meant to be collaborative and give you experience working with people you probably do not know. One successful approach is to first agree on a communication tool/protocol and a schedule. Next, discuss each person’s strengths and divide up responsibilities. Develop a schedule for completing tasks, who is responsible and a backup person in case an emergency situation occurs. Finally, check in regularly to ensure progress is being made and leave sometime to check and proof read each other's work. Especially because some students in your group may be remote for part of the class.

**Dealing with non-cooperative team members** -- If an issue occurs first try to work the issue out within your group. Save all documentation, emails, and chats as a record incase you need to contact course staff. We will step in and try to communicate with the student(s) to reach a resolution. If no resolution can be made, or the problem resurfaces, we reserve the right to move the student to a new group, or grade that student separately from the group, or any other action to resolve the issue.

**Group work is never easy** -- Teamwork, while difficult (especially during potentially remote interaction), is one of the most important skills you should learn and practice during college. In order to succeed communication is critical. You need to be in contact with your group regularly. This will help you keep on top of deliverables and make adjustments if problems should arise. We are always here to help, make use of our experience working in real engineering/science projects.

### Class/Web Conduct
In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the UC San Diego [principles of community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).

This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.

At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.

If you have a concern, please speak with myself, or your TAs. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that’s ok! The [OPHD](https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html) (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and [CARE](https://care.ucsd.edu/) (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.


### Academic Integrity
Don't cheat.

You are encouraged to (and at times will have to) work together and help one another. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit (quizzes/exams). For assignments, it is also your responsibility to ensure you understand everything your group has submitted and to make sure the correct file has been uploaded, that the upload is uncorrupted, and that it renders correctly. Projects may include ideas and code from other sources—but these other sources must be documented with clear attribution. Please review academic integrity policies [here](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu).

We anticipate you all doing well in this course; however, if you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, that’s ok! Should that occur, we recommend: (i.) asking questions in/after class, (ii.) attending office hours and/or (iii.) reaching out to course staff.

Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, this website, or Gradescope is down, or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact course staff via email (attach your assignment/quiz/exam answers) or else it will be graded as late.

### Disability​ ​Access
Students requesting accommodations due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. To arrange accommodations please contact OSD and they will help you get situated and contact me with follow up information/instructions.

### Questions & Feedback
**How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback**
It’s great that we have many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.

That said, to ensure that we’re respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they’re only obligated to answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9am-5pm). However, I know that’s not when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to reach out whenever is best for you while knowing that, you may not get a response until the next day. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question. 

We have created a contact us section on the website. This is a form for you to fill out, which will generate an email template, please use that to reach out to course staff. Thank you!

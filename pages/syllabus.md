## Other Good Stuff

### Teamwork Expectations
Your team will be working on the final together. We expect all students to, more or less, be equal contributors the final project. No one person should be doing a project, they are meant to be collaborative and give you experience working with people you probably do not know. One successful approach is to first agree on a communication tool/protocol and a schedule. Next, discuss each person’s strengths and divide up responsibilities. Develop a schedule for completing tasks, who is responsible and a backup person in case an emergency situation occurs. Finally, check in regularly to ensure progress is being made and leave sometime to check and proof read each other's work. Especially because some students in your group may be remote for part of the class.

**Dealing with non-cooperative team members** -- If an issue occurs first try to work the issue out within your group. Save all documentation, emails, and chats as a record incase you need to contact course staff. We will step in and try to communicate with the student(s) to reach a resolution. If no resolution can be made, or the problem resurfaces, we reserve the right to move the student to a new group, or grade that student separately from the group, or any other action to resolve the issue.

**Group work is never easy** -- Teamwork, while difficult (especially during potentially remote interaction), is one of the most important skills you should learn and practice during college. In order to succeed communication is critical. You need to be in contact with your group regularly. This will help you keep on top of deliverables and make adjustments if problems should arise. We are always here to help, make use of our experience working in real engineering/science projects.

### Class/Web Conduct
In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the UC San Diego [principles of community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).

This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.

At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.

If you have a concern, please speak with Kyle, or your TAs. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that’s ok! The [OPHD](https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html) (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and [CARE](https://care.ucsd.edu/) (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.


### Academic Integrity
Don't cheat.

You are encouraged to (and at times will have to) work together and help one another. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit (quizzes/exams). For assignments, it is also your responsibility to ensure you understand everything your group has submitted and to make sure the correct file has been uploaded, that the upload is uncorrupted, and that it renders correctly. Projects may include ideas and code from other sources—but these other sources must be documented with clear attribution. Please review academic integrity policies [here](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu).

We anticipate you all doing well in this course; however, if you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, that’s ok! Should that occur, we recommend: (i.) asking questions in/after class, (ii.) attending office hours and/or (iii.) reaching out to course staff.

Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, this website, or Gradescope is down, or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact course staff via email (attach your assignment/quiz/exam answers) or else it will be graded as late.

### Disability​ ​Access
Students requesting accommodations due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. To arrange accommodations please contact Kyle [kshannon@ucsd.edu](kshannon@ucsd.edu) privately, I will loop in the appropriate course staff to act as a liaison.

Contacting the OSD can help you further:

### Questions & Feedback
**How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback**
It’s great that we have many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.

That said, to ensure that we’re respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they’re only obligated to answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9am-5pm). However, I know that’s not when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to reach out whenever is best for you while knowing that, you may not get a response until the next day. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question. If there is an emergency and you need to contact staff immediately, email Kyle and put "EMERGENCY-COGS9" in the subject line. I will get back to you ASAP.

If you have…
- **questions about course content** - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered, please post questions, or ask during class/office hours.
- **questions about course logistics** - first, check the syllabus. If the answer is not there, ask in Section, ask a classmate, or ask during class/office hours.
- **something super cool to share related to class** - feel free to email Kyle [kshannon@ucsd.edu](kshannon@ucsd.edu)) or come to office hours. Be sure to include COGS9 in the email subject line and your full name in your message.
- **something you want to talk about in-depth** - meet in person/digitally during office hours or schedule a time to meet 1:1 by email. Be sure to include COGS9 in the email subject line. Or it may be missed. [kshannon@ucsd.edu](kshannon@ucsd.edu).
